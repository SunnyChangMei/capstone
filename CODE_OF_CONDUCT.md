#Daily process

1. Morning standup led by Taskmaster at 10:30a.m. Each team member says:

   - What he did yesterday
   - What blocks (if any) he's run into
   - What he plans to work on next
   - Group decides on (new) pairs for the day

2. Standup repeated at 2:30p.m.

3. At 5:30 Make sure everyone has commited any updates for the day, and resolve as many pull requests as possible.

4. If someone wants to continue working on a task alone in the evening, he must inform the team and get approval beforehand.

5. Similar to #4, if team members want to work on the weekend (alone or as a group), they should inform the rest of the team and get approval for the task they want to complete.

#Roles:

1. Assigned throughout the project, can rotate as necessary.
2. If someone wants the opportunity to perform a role, he must be assigned the role at least once.

#Making major decisions about the project:

1. If someone has a suggestion, he is responsible for clarifying it to the team.
2. If there are conflicting suggestions, the team will discuss pros and cons of each decision and come to a consensus.
   - If no consensus can be reached, the team will ask an instructor or fellow to step in.

#Dealing with challenges:

1. If a pair is completely stuck (i.e. making absolutely no progress) for 15-20 minutes, they should ask the other pair.
   - Check first: "Can you talk to us about this problem for a minute?"
   - The other pair can indicate if they are free now or if they want to wrap up a task they're working on.

If this does not help, then the pair should send a help ticket.

2. If we are not reaching our projected milestones, the team will regroup and discuss how to organize work more efficiently.

3. If a team-member or individual is stuck on a task for more than a half-day, he should ask for help, and all team-members must be proactive about intervening/helping.

4. The team should remember that the primary goal is to have a final project that we are proud of.

#Pair coding:

1. We will generally pair for all coding.

2. Pairs will rotate regularly (approx. once per day)

3. The pair should decide at the start who will drive/navigate first, and how to decide when to switch. Both members must have the opportunity to do both roles.

#Git commits/pull requests

0. Always make a new branch when starting on a minor feature. Name the branch clearly.

1. Commit frequently!! Each time a "chunk" of functional code is written.

1. Commit messages should be explicit and semantic.

1. Pull requests should be made as soon as a minor feature is completed. At an absolute minimum, once per day.

1. The other pair (not the one making the request) should approve and merge the branch.

- If this pull request must be resolved in order for the pair to continue working, ask the other pair to approve/merge ASAP

#Task board

1.  Each pair should update the task board when they realize a new issue needs to be added.
2.  At 5:30p.m. (or more often if necessary), the task board should be updated by Taskmaster or by the whole team.

- Tasks should be added/removed, or moved to a different status on the task board.

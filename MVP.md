#TEAM MVP

- Description of the idea:

Our app is an interactive experience that will use a camera to understand the users current pose and position to render pre-defined shapes on the screen. The user will meet objectives set by the application by forming the appropriate shape in the appropriate position.

MVP: The program will correctly render two shapes and fall down into position and stack on each other on a Tetris style grid.

Examples for shapes:
  1. 1x4 line
  2. 3x2 T shape
  3. 3x2 L shape
  4. 2x2 Square

Examples for positions:
  1. Move left
  2. Move right
  3. Rotation (in 90 degree increments)


Goal for Monday [7/1/19]: Initially our goal is to create a basic comprehension of a single pose (standing up straight with arms up to represent a vertical line element)





- Problems we are solving:

Encourage physical activity through a popular gaming format with real-time interactive feedback.



- Other details/stack:

We aim to achieve this via using the following technologies:
  1. React
  2. Redux
  3. TensorFlow / Posenet:  real-time human pose estimation in the browser.
  4. Database: TBD test



- Stretch goals:
  1. Ability to rotate shapes
  2. Rows disappear upon completion
  3. Point scoring system
  4. Variable of speed of gaming
  5. Multiplayer team-mode option
  6. Ability to store scores and profiles
  7. Calibrate for multiple user sizes
